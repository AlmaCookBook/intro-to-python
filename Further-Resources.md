### Other IDEs
Jupyter notebooks are great for small problems that you want to test out, and for sharing and demonstrating ideas. 
For larger projects you may want to use a different IDE.
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), Kareem’s favourite, but maybe not the easiest to use on first pass.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), another popular choice amongst developers and Rachel’s favourite– it is language agnostic – but relies on the user installing extensions they care about.

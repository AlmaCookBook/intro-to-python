The welcome mat is in the audiozone of the piano playing, but as soon as you move elsewhere it will stop. You can move with arrow keys or just by double clicking where you want to go. Each of the rooms and lecture theatre is soundproofed. The screenshare is restricted to a room when the door is shut.  \n",

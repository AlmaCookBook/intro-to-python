    "Work through each of these notebooks in order, checking the solutions  in the solutions directory as you go. If you have any questions you can contact scsoftware.icr.ac.uk or try the python-training slack group in Scientific Computing Services. It is intended that the material might take roughly 2 days. The first day is mostly acquiring concepts and the second day is mostly practice.\n",

    "When online, the exercise time will be quiet time, and then when we come back as a group I will give space for asking questions and sharing answers. There are breakout rooms available either for 1:1 help in the quiet times, or for working with a colleague if you wish. Teams doesn't allow you to move yourself so if you would like to do this I will move you in at the start of the quiet times. Otherwise I will leave the main room quiet with the reconvene time showing. Take a break during these quiet times when you need it.\n",
